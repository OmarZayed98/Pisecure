This project was developed by Omar Zayed and Vanessa Lama. 
We recieved a lot of help from the online tutorials offered by pyimagesearch.

it also streams to local ip address.

To run the main file  streamAndFaceRecognition.py --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Keep in mind the ip address should be the one associated with you raspberry pi.
